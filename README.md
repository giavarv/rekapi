# Rekapi - Keyframes for JavaScript

Rekapi is a keyframe animation library for JavaScript.  It gives you:

* A keyframe-based Model by which to structure an animation
* Controller APIs to control the playback of an animation

Rekapi does not define drawing methods.  That part is completely generic, and
the library exposes a common interface for defining Views.

Rekapi has two dependencies:
[Underscore](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore) and
[Shifty](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/shifty).

Rekapi has been tested in and supports:

  * Modern HTML5 browsers
  * IE 7/8 (9 probably works; has not been tested)
  * Node.js

Please note:  Rekapi is a rewrite of
[Kapi](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/kapi). Rekapi is very similar to Kapi,
but they are not identical.  Rekapi is not a drop-in replacement for Kapi.
Rekapi is way awesomer, so you should use it instead.

The API may change somewhat before reaching 1.0.  __[See how to upgrade from
older versions.

## What is keyframing?

Keyframing is an animation technique for defining states at specific points in
time. Animations are always rendered as frames to the screen, and keyframing
allows you to define the key points at which the motion in the animation
changes - all of the frames that exist between those points are interpolated
for you.  It is a powerful way to construct a complex animation.

## How do I use Rekapi?

A Rekapi animation is structured into a Model and Views, with Controller
methods to manage the playback. Its usage boils down to four steps:

* Define some `Kapi.Actor` Views
* Instantiate and add the Views to a `Kapi` Model instance
* Define keyframes (states) for the View instances
* Play the animation with the Controller methods

## Model - Kapi

The Model maintains the state of an animation.  Rekapi's Model is represented
by the `Kapi` Object.  The Model controls the state of the animation and
renders the Views.

## View - Kapi.Actor

The Actors are the individual components of an animation.  If you want to move
a circle from left to right in your animation, that circle is an Actor.  If you
want to add a square to your animation that moves up and down, that square is
another, separate actor.  Actors are represented by the `Kapi.Actor` Object and
its subclasses.

## Controller methods

There are numerous Controller-type methods attached to the `Kapi` Object.
These methods include `play()`, `pause()` and `stop()`.

## Contexts

Rekapi works by passing data from a Model to a View.  The View then renders the
data based on a context.  Rekapi treats contexts generically, and you can add
more as you need them.  Currently, the standard Rekapi build includes rendering
contexts for the DOM and `<canvas>`.

A Rekapi context does two things: It extends the prototype of the standard
Rekapi Objects (`Kapi`, `Kapi.Actor`), and it subclasses `Kapi.Actor`.  This is
how Rekapi renders to the `<canvas>` and DOM: The Canvas and DOM renderers
create `Kapi.CanvasActor` and `Kapi.DOMActor`, respectively.

The `Kapi.Actor` base class only renders raw data, it doesn't represent data
visually because it doesn't have a context.  Use `Kapi.DOMActor` and
`Kapi.CanvasActor` to render to the screen.

## AMD

Alternatively, you can load Rekapi as an
[AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) module by using a loader
such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org). This has the added benefit of not
creating any `Kapi`, `Tweenable` (from Shifty) or `_` global variables, unlike
in the previous code samples.

Caution: You can only require `rekapi.js` or `rekapi.min.js` as AMD modules. It
will not work with `rekapi.bundle.min.js`.

Here is an example of how you can use it with RequireJS:

````javascript
// This example assumes that there is a `lib` directory in your project
require.config({
  paths: {
    shifty: "lib/shifty",
    underscore: "lib/underscore.min",
    rekapi: "lib/rekapi"
  }
});

// Dependencies (Underscore and Shifty) are automatically loaded.
require(['rekapi'], function(Kapi) {
  var kapi = new Kapi();
});
````

## Node

Rekapi can be used in Node.js.  This can be useful for generating keyframe
data.  Usage is the same as in the browser.  Loading the code requires the
[r.js](https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/dist/r.js) script and looks
a lot ike the AMD approach above:

````javascript
var r = require('lib/r.js');
r.config({
  paths: {
    shifty: "dist/shifty",
    underscore: "dist/_",
    rekapi: "dist/rekapi"
  }
});

r(['rekapi'], function(Kapi) {
  var kapi = new Kapi();
});
````

If you find any bugs, have suggestions or questions, please post them them to
the [Rekapi Github issue
tracker](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/rekapi/issues).

## Building and contributing

If you'd like to download entirety of this repo, please note that it uses Git
submodules.  You will need to clone it like so:

````
$: git clone --recursive git@github.com:jeremyckahn/rekapi.git
````

The `--recursive` flag tells Git to download the submodules in addition to the
Rekapi files.  You will need these submodules in order to build Rekapi or run
the tests.

If you make a change to the Rekapi source and would like to build the project,
just run this from the Rekapi root directory on the command line:

````
sh build.sh <version> [<local_compiler_path>]
````

`version` is whatever version you want to call the build.  Rekapi uses the
[SemVer](http://semver.org/) versioning scheme.  This will generate any files
you need and place them into the `dist/` directory.  You can specify a local
copy of the Google Closure compiler with `local_compiler_path`, if you have it.
If you omit the `local_compiler_path` variable, then the script will `curl` out
to the Closure compiler on the web.  This will just work if you are on a Mac.
On Linux, you may need run `sudo apt-get install curl`.

It's also important to make sure you didn't break any tests in `tests/`.  You
can take a quick look by opening `tests/test.all_unit_tests.html` in your
browser.
